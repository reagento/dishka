Using with frameworks
*******************************

There are some integrations in library, however you are not limited to them only.
You can create custom integrations for your framework of choice.
Some of the integrations are supported by a community, refer to their documentation as well.

Common approach
=====================

For several frameworks library contains helper functions so you don't need to control scopes yourself, but just annotate handler/view functions and change application startup code

To use framework integration you mainly need to do 3 things:

* call ``setup_dishka`` on your container and framework entity
* add ``FromDishka[YourClass]`` on you framework handlers (or view-functions)
* decorate your handlers with ``@inject`` before registering them in framework. Some integrations do not required it, see their details
* add additional provider to the container to access framework specific objects from your provider

.. note::
   ``FromDishka[T]`` is basically a synonym for ``Annotated[T, FromComponent()]`` and is used to get an object from default component. To use other component you can use the same syntax with annotated ``Annotated[T, FromComponent("X")]``.

   For more details on components see :ref:`components`

For such integrations library enters scope for each generated event. So, if you have standard scope, than handler dependencies will be retrieved as for ``Scope.REQUEST``.
For streaming protocols and websockets you will be also to have ``SESSION``-scoped objects with a lifespan of the whole stream.

Additionally, you may need to call ``container.close()`` in the end of your application lifecycle if you want to finalize APP-scoped dependencies

Some frameworks have their own specific, check corresponding page.

For FastAPI it will look like:

.. code-block:: python

   from dishka.integrations.fastapi import FromDishka, inject, setup_dishka, FastapiProvider

   @router.get("/")
   @inject
   async def index(interactor: FromDishka[Interactor]) -> str:
       result = interactor()
       return result

   app = FastAPI()
   container = make_async_container(your_provider, FastapiProvider())
   setup_dishka(container, app)
