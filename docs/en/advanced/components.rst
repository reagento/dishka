Components and providers isolation
****************************************

Problem definition
===========================

As you know, container can be created from multiple providers, which are dynamically bound together. It allows you to reuse them or partially override in tests. It works well while you have different types across all provided objects. But what if there are some intersections. Let's talk about three situations:

1. Only several types are used with different meaning within a monolithic app.
2. Several parts of an application are developed them more or less independently, while they used within same processing context
3. You have a modular application with multiple bounded contexts

**First situation** can appear when you have for-example multiple thread pools for different tasks or multiple database connections for different databases. While they have special meaning you distinguish them by creating new types

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import NewType

    MainDbConnection = NewType("MainDbConnection", Connection)

Once you have different types dishka can now understand which one is used in each place

In the **third situation** you actually have mini-applications inside bigger one with their own scopes and event lifecycle. So just create multiple containers.

The different thing is when you have a bunch of different types and you do not want or even cannot replace them with new types as in p.1. For this case we have a different concept - **components**.


Component
==============
**Component** - is an isolated group of providers within the same container identified by a string. There is always a default component (``DEFAULT_COMPONENT=""``).

Component is **set for the whole provider**, but single provider can be used in multiple components using ``.to_component(name)``.

.. code-block:: python

    from dishka import make_container, Provider

    # default component is used when not specified
    provider0 = Provider()

    class MyProvider(Provider):
        # component can be set in class
        component = "component_name"

    provider1 = MyProvider()

    # component can be set on instance creation
    provider2 = MyProvider(component="other")

    # same provider instance is casted to use with different component
    provider3 = provider2.to_component("additional")

    container = make_container(provider0, provider1, provider2, provider3)

Components are **isolated**: provider cannot implicitly request an object from another component. In the following code ``MainProvider.foo`` requests integer value which is only provided in separate component. In the code below there is an error in dependency graph, so we will disable validation to show runtime behavior:

.. code-block:: python

    from dishka import make_container, Provider, provide, Scope

    class MainProvider(Provider):
        # default component is used here

        @provide(scope=Scope.APP)
        def foo(self, a: int) -> float:
            return a/10


    class AdditionalProvider(Provider):
        component = "X"

        @provide(scope=Scope.APP)
        def foo(self) -> int:
            return 1

    # we will get error immediately during container creation, skip validation for demo needs
    container = make_container(MainProvider(), AdditionalProvider(), skip_validation=True)
    # retrieve from component "X"
    container.get(int, component="X")  # value 1 would be returned
    # retrieve from default component
    container.get(float)  # raises NoFactoryError because int is in another component


If the same type is provided in multiple components, it is searched only within the same component as its dependant, unless it is declared explicitly.

Components can **link to each other**: each provider can add a component name when declaring a dependency by ``FromComponent`` type annotation.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Annotated
    from dishka import FromComponent, make_container, Provider, provide, Scope

    class MainProvider(Provider):

        @provide(scope=Scope.APP)
        def foo(self, a: Annotated[int, FromComponent("X")]) -> float:
            return a/10


    class AdditionalProvider(Provider):
        component = "X"

        @provide(scope=Scope.APP)
        def foo(self) -> int:
            return 1

    container = make_container(MainProvider(), AdditionalProvider())
    container.get(float)  # returns 0.1


``alias`` now can be used across components without changing the type:

.. code-block:: python

    a = alias(int, component="X")


.. note::
    In frameworks integrations ``FromDishka[T]`` is used to get an object from default component. To use other component you can use the same syntax with annotated ``Annotated[T, FromComponent("X")]``
