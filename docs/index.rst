dishka
=============================================

Cute DI framework with scopes and agreeable API.

This library provides **IoC container** that's genuinely useful.
If you're exhausted from endlessly passing objects just to create other objects, only to have those objects create even
more â€” you're not alone, and we have a solution.
Not every project requires IoC container, but take a look at what we offer.

Unlike other tools, ``dishka`` focuses **only**
on **dependency injection** without trying to solve unrelated tasks.
It keeps DI in place without cluttering your code with global variables and scattered specifiers.

Key features:

* **Scopes**. Any object can have a lifespan for the entire app, a single request, or even more fractionally. Many
  frameworks either lack scopes completely or offer only two. Here, you can define as many scopes as needed.
* **Finalization**. Some dependencies, like database connections, need not only to be created but also carefully
  released. Many frameworks lack this essential feature.
* **Modular providers**. Instead of creating many separate functions or one large class, you can split factories
  into smaller classes for easier reuse.
* **Clean dependencies**. You don't need to add custom markers to dependency code just to make it visible to the
  library.
* **Simple API**. Only a few objects are needed to start using the library.
* **Framework integrations**. Popular frameworks are supported out of the box. You can simply extend it for your needs.
* **Speed**. The library is fast enough that performance is not a concern. In fact, it outperforms many
  alternatives.
